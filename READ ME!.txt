Greetings. This is my programming assignment based on the theme of "Reflections"
It is a 2D tower defense game, where you you can buy and upgrade tower with the end goal of surviving as much as you can.
A special mechanic to stand out: Any towers you buy need to be activated with another projectile that is emitted only by the "Player Objective"
That projectile can be redirectioned/multiplied using the Prism and Mirror Towers.

Controls are simple. Only left click since this is can also be played on a touch screen device (Tested on Android)
While in game, press on a tower to open the upgrade menu for that tower or on an empty space to open the in game menu. 
Click and hold for more than 0.2 seconds to be able to target where you want your Player Objective to shoot.

The game was done in C++ using Unreal Engine, created and distributed by Epic Games.

I claim no copyright over the assets downloaded here and used as sprites for towers.

I also claim no copyright over the algorithm that I used to generate the number of enemies each wave.

I must thank to my friends who created the general concept for the levels and named them. I feel it is right to give them credit for them here.
